# Reading Data on cmd_vel Using MATLAB

You can follow any available youtube video to Install MATLAB in your Linux system.<br>
I would suggest to use the following command everytime you wish to run MATLAB,
> sudo matlab

Install **ROS Toolbox** in your MATLAB,<br>
Also use MATLAB2024Ra or any version after that, I'm using 2024Ra because of it being the most recent version <br>
available by the time I'm writing this, version before 2024Ra are not compaitable with PX4 1.14 (latest version by tis time)
